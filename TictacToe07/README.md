Here is a draft description of a Tic Tac Toe app built with React Native:

Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging mobile app that allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on the same device. It was developed using React Native, enabling it to have native speeds on both iOS and Android platforms while sharing the majority of the codebase.  

The app features a minimalist design with an easy-to-use interface. Players can tap on the 3x3 grid to place their X or O. The app highlights the current player's turn and blocks invalid moves. Players are notified when there is a winner or if there is a draw.

Game options include playing against a friend on the same device or playing against a configurable AI opponent with three difficulty settings. Players can choose to play on either a 3x3 or 5x5 grid for more complexity.

Built-in animations make for smooth gameplay and transitions. The app also includes ambient sound effects to enhance the experience. Game statistics are tracked so players can review their wins, losses and draws.

Overall, Tic Tac Toe delivers a straightforward, responsive cross-platform mobile experience for the classic game. The use of React Native helped reduce development time while still resulting in a highly polished app.
